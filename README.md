# Coding-Projects
## This repo includes all previous projects I have coded in various languages
#### I have a C++ based lego-like store where you can shop for lego sets
#### I have a website based onstarwars-themed I built with various information
#### I have a Java based project on a video game character, weapon, and map picker/maker for the game Valorant
#### I have a Java based capstone project (Mama's Piddlin's) that is a fully funtioning application.  It is a inventory tracking system designed to manage materials, pricing, and time spent (in minutes or hours) on creating custom items. It will also include features for donation tracking, item sales, and price selling calculations.
